                        My name is Jack. I am a junior here at St. Thomas and I am obviously majoring in computer science 
                        but I am also a major in data science. I am from Prior Lake, Minnesota which is about 45 minutes south of
                        the twin cities. I chose computer science due to an interest in coding/computing compounded with computer
                        science sounding like it would be a good thing to get into in terms of a career. So far I am due to graduate
                        a semester early, that means fall of next year. I kind of look forward to finishing college and seeing 
                        what's ahead.

                        Vuejs is a comprehensive framework for building websites. We used it on this website. Really, the main
                        features of it are how it changes how html, css, and javascript are written. It changes them in order
                        to be more efficient compared to stock html, css, and javascript files.

                    <p>
                        Foundation is similar to vue in that it is used to build websites. It is different however in that it is not
                        as comprehensive. Vue changes your file layout to where html, css, and javascript are all in one file
                        which leads to a completely different structure in terms of making a website. Foundation does not do that,
                        it simply adds a lot of classes which allow you to specify the design of your website and be able to do
                        stuff like add fancy menus and stuff.

                        Leaflet is an api that allows you so imbed maps in your website and interact/change them. We used Leaflet
                        in our project to show the map and update neighborhood statistics. On the main page of our project,
                        the interactive map and the stuff like the boarder and arrows are all Leaflet api.

                    <p>
                        Nominatim is an api that is not directly visible on the the website, however it serve as an important 
                        part of our website. Nominatim allows you to type in the name of a place and get a specific address
                        for that place. For example, if you typed into the find address box "st thomas" "University Of St thomas"
                        or "St Thomas Minnesota" all of those answers would point you to the right place because we used 
                        Nominatim to give it the addres provided and get an exact address for use with the Leaflet api.

                        The St. Paul crime ai is an api we created. It simply allows things like get requests for crime data and returns
                        a formetted json in order to parse the data into our website. In our project, we even have the capacity
                        to add a crime to the database with the crime api's put functionality.

                    <p>1. API's can interact with each other. If you were to ask me at the start of learning about api's if api's can interact with each other, I would probably say yes, but really understanding how they interact and the potential of them is something I have only learned recently. Seeing how the leaflet api gives us a map to work with for use with Nominatim to help with addresses while also using our crime database api to show things on the map related to the database is a very neat and very useful puzzle where you get to see how all of the pieces connect.</p>
                    <p>2. Comprehensive frameworks like Vue can save a lot of time. Really, even now, I still do not fully understand how Vue works. However with the work that I have done with it and the somewhat understanding of its components, I can see how frameworks like Vue, or even competetors like React or Angular can save time. Having everything in one file and not having to swap back and forth can make things simpler and increase efficiency.</p>
                    <p>3. Content Origin policy. I bring this up because we had a lot of trouble with content origin policy when trying to get our project to connect to our St. Paul crime database. Overall I think we can definitivly say we learned about this when doing this project.</p>
